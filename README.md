# File Reader Application

This is a simple Rust application that reads a file and prints its contents line by line to the console.

## Description

The application takes a file path as a command-line argument, opens the file, and prints each line to the console. It handles errors gracefully, providing specific messages for common issues such as the file not being found. I used the Rust template from week 2's external lab exercise of Coursera's Rust Fundamentals, which can be found at this [repository](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-template).

## Usage

```bash
cargo run test.txt
```
